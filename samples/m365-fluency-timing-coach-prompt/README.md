# üí¨ Fluency and ‚è±Ô∏è Timing Coach

![Fluency and Timing coach Demo](./assets/demo.gif)

## Summary

Preparing for a demo or presentation often requires crafting notes about what you plan to say and do. If English is not your first language, this script will help by:

- Optimizing the fluency of your notes
- Adding estimated speaking times for each section
- Summarizing the changes to help you learn and improve

### How to Use

Please replace the placeholders in the script as follows:
- **[mylanguage]**: Your native language, such as French, Italian, German, etc.
- **[speed]**: Your speaking speed. A typical speaking speed is between 130-150 words per minute.

### Example Structure

Your notes should follow this structure, with headings in capital letters:

**MYSELF**  
"Hello, my name is ... and I am a software developer passionate about implementing outstanding solutions."

**INTRO**  
"I will demonstrate a component/application I developed for a company, which enhances customer engagement through Copilot."

**SWITCH TO VSCODE**  
"Now, I will show you the VSCode environment. The key implementation resides in the `CopilotToCustomer` class, which facilitates communication with the customer."

**THANKS**  
"Thank you for your attention. Please feel free to ask any questions."

## Promptüí°

**Scenario:**  

I am presenting at a Microsoft Community Call. Below is my presentation script.

**Instructions:**

 
1. **Sentence Optimization:**  

   Simplify and adjust the English sentences for easier articulation. Since [mylanguage] is my mother tongue, optimize the script for smooth pronunciation, taking phonetics into account to enhance fluency.

2. **Speaking Time Indicators:**  

   For each heading (in capital letters), include:

   - Estimated speaking time for the section following the heading (mm:ss).

   - Cumulative "Total Time" from the start of the presentation to that point (mm:ss).  

Do not add additional time for explanations. Use [speed] words per minutes as a speaking rate

3. **Summary of Changes:**  

   Provide a table listing all changes, explaining:

   - Why each change was made.

   - How it improves the script's ease of speaking for a native French speaker.  

   This will allow me to review and learn from the adjustments.


### Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This prompt serves the following purposes:

- **Improves fluency**: Optimizes the speaker's notes for non-native English speakers, making it easier to present with confidence.
- **Adds speaking time**: Provides helpful timing information to guide the speaker through the presentation.
- **Summarizes changes**: Highlights adjustments made to the script, offering learning opportunities for improved speaking skills.
