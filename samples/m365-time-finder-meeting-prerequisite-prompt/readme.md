# üöÄ Find meeting time with another user - a prerequisite prompt example üìÖ

![Demo of finding meeting time with another user](./assets/demo.png)

## Summary

This is a revision of the 'Find meeting time with another user' prompt. It demonstrates the concept of a 'prerequisite' prompt. A prerequisite prompt requires input from the user before performing any actions. In this case, it asks the user for the person they want to schedule a meeting with and the day for the meeting. 

## Original Prompt üí°

 Identify an available time for a meeting with [User] tomorrow that aligns with their working hours in their timezone and does not conflict with either my or their existing meetings. 

 ## Prerequisite Prompt üí°
You are my personal assistant helping me coordinate and schedule meetings. Ask the user to input the person they wish to meet with. Then ask on which day they want to meet. Do not provide a response until the user has responded to you. Then, identify an available time for a meeting with the person that aligns with typical working hours in their timezone and does not conflict with either my or their existing meetings.

## Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This technique allows for a single prompt to serve multiple purposes, akin to a function in programming that can be called with different arguments to produce different outcomes. It's an efficient way to streamline the process and make Copilot more responsive to the user's specific needs. Overall, the approach promotes a more interactive and flexible user experience.
