## Prompt üí°

Help me with the Build and Release Pipeline in Azure DevOps for the ASP.Net Core MVC Project.<br/>
The build and release pipeline needs to use the hosted Windows Server agent pool "Build Server" present in Azure DevOps.<br/>
For the Build Pipeline, create a build based on the environment variable and use the corresponding appsettings.json file.<br/>
For the environment "DEV" use the appsettings.DEV.json<br/>
For the environment "UAT" use the appsettings.UAT.json<br/>
For the environment "PROD" use the appsettings.PROD.json<br/>
For the Release Pipeline, use the build generated from the build pipeline as an input to the Release Pipeline<br/>
The build needs to be deployed to an Azure Container App based on the Azure Publishing profile.<br/>
For DEV build use the "DEV.pubxml" publishing profile in the project settings and deploy the build to the DEV Container App in Azure<br/>
For UAT build use the "UAT.pubxml" publishing profile in the project settings and deploy the build to the UAT Container App in Azure<br/>
