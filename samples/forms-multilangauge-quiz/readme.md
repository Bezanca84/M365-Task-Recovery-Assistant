./assets/demo.png

## Summary
This guide is designed to help you create a multilingual quiz in Microsoft Forms. Since Microsoft Forms does not natively support multiple languages in a single form, you will need to manually write the questions in each language. This can be a daunting and time-consuming task, but this guide will provide you with detailed instructions to make the process easier.

## Promptüí°

Create a multilingual quiz on a specific topic: [topic].  
Make this quiz in languages: [languages]. The title should be in all specified languages, separated by emojis (e.g., üåê). Use the subtitle for the second language. Translations should be added in the question subtitle. Each answer should contain each language version separated by emojis (e.g., üåê). If an answer is universal for each language (e.g., contains a mathematical or physical formula, numerical value, or proper noun), it should not be translated and should appear only once. Provide answer explanations in all specified languages.  
Specify the type of quiz: [quiz type] (e.g., multiselect, simple answer).  
Propose only [number] of questions.  
The difficulty level should be [level].  
Add the separator (e.g., üåê) in the description of the quiz as well.
