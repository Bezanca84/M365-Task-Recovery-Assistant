![Demo](./assets/Demo_Copilot_Forms_Quiz_Multilingual.gif)

## Summary

This guide provides a structured approach to creating multilingual quizzes in Microsoft Forms. Since Microsoft Forms does not natively support multiple languages within a single quiz, each question and answer must be manually entered in all required languages. To simplify this process, the guide offers a ready-to-use prompt and clear instructions to help you build consistent, professional, and accessible multilingual quizzes with minimal effort.

## Prompt üí°

Create a multilingual quiz in Microsoft Forms based on the parameters below:

- **Title**: Include all language versions separated by [separator].  
- **Description**: Use [separator] as a language divider.  
- **Questions**: Write the main question in the first language; provide translations in the subtitle, separated by [separator].  
- **Answers**: Provide each answer option in all selected languages, separated by [separator]. If an answer is universal (e.g., numbers, mathematical or scientific formulas, units of measurement, symbols and special characters, proper nouns, chemical elements or symbols, common acronyms or initialisms, dates or years), include it only once without translation.  
- **Explanations**: For each correct answer, include a short explanation in all languages, separated by [separator].

### Parameters:

- **Topic**:  
- **Languages**: English, Polish  
- **Number of questions**: 3  
- **Difficulty**: simple  
- **Quiz type**: Choose what suits you best for this topic  
- **Separator**: üåê
