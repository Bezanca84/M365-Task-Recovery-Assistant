![Demo](./assets/demo.gif)

## Summary üìú

This prompt utilises Microsoft Copilot to transform data into a structure that aligns with the user's preferred information framework.
It is an example where the 'context' has been gathered using speech to text, or copied and pasted from an email chain or chat and then appended with '
Reorganise the previous information into the format of Position, Problem, Possibilities, Proposal.'

## Prompt üí°
[*your context*] Reorganise the previous information into the format of Position, Problem, Possibilities, Proposal.

Example:

*A business user has Reported a problem with the power automate flow randomly stopping working they said they had the flow set up for years and that took results of a form and ported them to a sharepoint list it's been used almost daily with no problems and then they said that just the other day it randomly stopped working no errors just nothing happens the user remade the flow and it worked but they can't workout what happened, They want to know why the flow may have stopped working so that they can avoid these situations in the future. There could be a number of considerations to work could have stopped working it may have been to do with authentication some of those situations arise when the Account that owns the flow has been disabled or a token has expired or MFA For some reason requires the user to authenticate again also the underlying Sharepoint list could have had changes made to it such as permissioning on the list or the site or some other reason that would prevent the flow from writing to the list. You'll probably ask the user to first see if they can show the history of the flow to determine when it might have stopped if there were any errors in the past to see if you can ascertain a way forward, You might also ask about the count validity of the person that created the account and also see if there's anything that's happened in the past in the sharepoint space.*
