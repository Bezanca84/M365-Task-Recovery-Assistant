## Summary
This prompt is designed to automate the generation of meeting summaries by analyzing the latest email related to a meeting and extracting key points. It also creates actionable tasks in Planner based on the content of the email, schedules reminders, and sends a summary email to attendees. This helps streamline follow-ups and task management post-meetings.

## Prompt üí°

Analyze the most recent email with the subject "Meeting Planning" and summarize the key points. Create a task in Planner for each action item mentioned and schedule reminders for the next meeting on [date]. Send me an email with the summary and assigned tasks.

### Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è
This prompt will help automate post-meeting actions, saving time and ensuring follow-ups are tracked effectively.
