# Upcoming Week: Meeting Organization and Task Prep

![Sort emails by priority](./assets/demo.png)


## Summary

This prompt requests a structured overview of meetings for the upcoming week, prioritizing those where the user is the organizer without an agenda, followed by meetings where they have assigned tasks, and finally any other relevant meetings. Recurring status meetings are excluded unless they require preparation, and the output should be sorted by category and date.

## Promptüí°

Please prepare an overview of my meetings for the upcoming week with the following details:
List all meetings where I am the organizer, but exclude those that already have an agenda. Sort these by date.
List meetings where I am mentioned in the agenda and have specific tasks or action items to prepare. Sort these after the first category.
List any remaining relevant meetings that do not fall into the above categories but may still require my attention.
Do not include recurring meetings such as status meetings or routine check-ins unless I have a specific task to prepare.
Format the output in a structured way, grouping by category and sorting by date within each category.


### Description‚ÑπÔ∏è

Every Friday, I use this prompt to prepare for the upcoming week by organizing my meetings and tasks efficiently. The prompt generates a structured overview of my meetings, prioritizing:

* Meetings I organize without an agenda (to ensure I set one).
* Meetings where I have assigned tasks (so I can prepare in advance).

This process helps me stay on top of my responsibilities, ensuring that I have clarity on what needs to be done before the week starts.
