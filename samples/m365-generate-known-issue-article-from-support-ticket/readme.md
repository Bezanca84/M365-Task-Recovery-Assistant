## Summary

Consolidating knowledge from the experience of support teams could be daunting. With this Copilot prompt you can ease the transofrmation of tacit knoweldge into enterprise knowledge available to all your colleagues for future reference, generating an article to document the issue and the solution provided.

## Promptüí°

I'm creating a new known issue article for our support knowledge management system that offers solutions to issues that already happened to our customers and have been solved sucessfully providing instructions. 
Use the attached conversation between the customer and our customer success team to write the article about the issue solved in the attached ticket. The article content must not mention any individuals or company names and should remain fully anonymized. 
The article structure should contain at least the following sections: 
- Brief description of the issue and context where relevant. 
- Solution provided, very brief without adding any verbose added to what was actually provided. Please double check there aren't any names or references to company names included in the resulting article.
