# Create a Patch Function to Update a record in Powerapps using Github Copilot

![GitHub Copilot interface in Visual Studio Code showing an extended prompt. The prompt asks: 'Can you write PowerFx code to create a new record in PowerApps?

## Summary

The Patch function in Power Fx is used to update or modify records in a data source. It works by specifying three main components: the data source you want to update, the specific record you wish to modify, and the new values for the fields you want to change. To identify the record, you typically use a function like "LookUp" based on a unique identifier or condition. Once the target record is found, the Patch function allows you to update specific fields without affecting the rest of the data. This is a powerful method for making updates to individual records within a data source while keeping the other data intact.

## Promptüí°

Can you write PowerFx code to create a new record in PowerApps? I need to add a new record to a data source named `EmployeeData`. The new record should include fields for `Name`, `Position`, and `HireDate`, and these values will be entered through text input controls (`TextInput_Name`, `TextInput_Position`) and a date picker (`DatePicker_HireDate`). The formula should trigger when a button is clicked, and it should validate that all fields are filled before creating the record. If any field is empty, display an error notification. If all fields are valid, display a success notification after the new record is added.

### Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The Patch function in Power Fx allows you to add new data to a data source without affecting the rest of the data.
