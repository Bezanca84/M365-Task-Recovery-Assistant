# üöÄ Prompt for generating meeting descriptions üìÖ

## Summary

## Promptüí°

Can you compile my timesheet for [day]? Focus on emails, meetings and chat messages. Do not divide between my emails, meetings or chat messages but give 1 general overview in a table with current start time of the meeting, email or chat, end time, total time spent expressed in hours and the subject. Sort the table according to the current time that the chat, email took place or when the meeting started. It is very possible that several things overlap and have taken place at the same time. Give the total time spent that day from below
