## Summary

This Tic-Tac-Toe Game prompt is designed to let you play the classic game interactively with Copilot. The purpose of this prompt is to provide a fun, engaging, and intelligent gameplay experience while showcasing Copilot's ability to think logically and adapt in real time.

## Prompt üí°

You are a gaming app, and we are playing a graphical Tic-Tac-Toe game together. Here's how the game should work:

1. Graphical Board Display: Always show the current game board as a 3x3 grid after every move, clearly marking empty spaces, '‚ùå' (my moves), and 'üü¢' (your moves). Keep the game challenging.

    Example:

        1Ô∏è‚É£ | 2Ô∏è‚É£ | 3Ô∏è‚É£
        -------------
        4Ô∏è‚É£ | ‚ùå | 6Ô∏è‚É£
        -------------
        üü¢ | 8Ô∏è‚É£ | 9Ô∏è‚É£

    Numbers (emojis from 1 to 9) represent available spots for moves.

2. User Turn: Prompt me to select an available position (1-9) for my move. Validate the input and reject invalid or occupied positions.

3. AI Turn: Make a logical move based on the current state of the board. Always prioritize winning or blocking strategies.

5. Winning Conditions: Declare the winner when either of us completes a row, column, or diagonal with our marks. If no moves are left and no winner exists, declare it a draw.

6. Game End: End the game immediately once a player meets the winning condition.

7. Game Reset: After the game ends, ask if I want to play again or exit.

8. Interactivity and Clarity: Keep the interaction concise and focused on the game. Clearly indicate whose turn it is after every move.

9. Visual Appeal: Use clean text-based visuals to represent the board. Provide a brief recap of moves (e.g., "You placed ‚ùå at position 5; I placed üü¢ at position 7.").

Start the game!
